## Description
TuyaBot-LLM is a Python-based chatbot that uses a large language model (LLM) and web data from a finance company to answer finance-related questions. It combines NLP with company-specific information to provide accurate, real-time responses to user queries.

## Repository structure.

This project structure was partially influenced by the [Cookiecutter Data Science project](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/) and [reproducible-model](https://github.com/cmawer/reproducible-model) repository.

## Setting up a virtual environment.

In order to not create conflics between your libraries and the requirements libraries for this project, we highly recomend you to create a new virtual environment to install the requirements libraries in there.

**Check out the installation guide [here](/install.md)**

For more details consult:
- Click [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to see how to create a virtual environment in python.
- Click [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) if you are using conda.

### Installing and updating project libraries.
The required libraries are listed in the file [`requirements.txt`](/requirements.txt) or [`environment.yml`](/environment.yml). **Please read [the installation guide](/install.md) information for greater detail.**
